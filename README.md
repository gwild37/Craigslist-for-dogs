### Craigslist but for Dogs

> Project idea: We provide a free service where users must upload a minimum 11,477 by 7,965 image of their dogs.

#### License
> GPL v3

#### Why GPL v3?
> We are using the GPL v3 license because we don't want any proprietary projects to make use of our code. This is opposed to the Apache 2.0 license from the original project. 

#### Business Model
> We provide a space telescope. We take pictures of dogs with the space telescope. We charge for users to use the space telescope
